Account-to-account payment powered by open banking.

== Description ==

Card fees are expensive and bank transfers are slow and inconvenient. With open banking, Crezco provides instant and secure account-to-account payments with a great user experience.
The result is a frictionless payment solution that can be used as an additional checkout alternative to traditional payment methods or as a stand alone solution.

= How it works =

1. **Select your bank.** Review the payment then select your bank. Crezco will securely redirect you to your bank to authorise the payment.
2. **Approve payment.** Crezco securely communicates payment instructions to your bank. You just need to approve the payment in your banking app.
3. **Payment sent.** The payment is initiated by your bank. Crezco does not touch your money and only the confirmed payment will be sent.

Built and supported by [Crezco](https://www.crezco.com/).

= A convenient checkout =

* **Instant and frictionless.** Receive funds the second the payment is authorized.
* **Better user experience.** No need to enter and share card details online.
* **No cards required.** Eliminate card fees and chargebacks.
* **Share anywhere.** Share a link or a QR code by text, email or any other online channel.

= Extra layer of protection for buyers =

* No sensitive data stored
* No card details required

* Fully compliant with all security requirements
